I am a **Software Engineer** and **U.S. Army veteran** with a **Top Secret SCI clearance** and over 20 years of experience leading teams and managing secure, mission-critical systems for the Department of Defense. My career has been dedicated to ensuring operational integrity and security, from the tactical edge to strategic intelligence environments at the **National Security Agency (NSA)**.

Driven by a passion for problem-solving and a desire to build impactful tools, I transitioned into software development. I recently completed the **Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA)** for Cloud Application Development, where I honed my skills in C#, .NET, and Azure. My goal is to leverage my unique background in security and leadership to build robust, secure, and user-centric applications.
