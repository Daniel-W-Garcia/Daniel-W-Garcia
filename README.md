After 20+ years with Uncle Sam (still maintain a **Top Secret SCI clearance** ) I have decided to pivot into what I have always been passionate about.

My brain loves problem-solving and I really just want to build to build impactful tools. I have always been a tech nerd, so I transitioned into software development. I recently completed the **Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA)** for Cloud Application Development, where I honed my skills in C#, .NET, and Azure.

### ðŸ”§ My Tech Stack & Skills

**Languages & Frameworks:**
*   C# | .NET MAUI | Python | SQL | HTML | PowerShell

**Cloud & Platforms:**
*   Microsoft Azure | Azure DevOps
*   Windows & Linux Environments

### ðŸš€ Featured Project: VA Disability & Compensation Calculator

I developed a cross-platform mobile application to help fellow veterans navigate the complexities of the VA disability rating system. The app has been downloaded over **10,000 times** across the Google Play and Apple App Stores.

*   **Technology:** Built with **.NET MAUI** from a single C# codebase for both Android and iOS.
*   **Purpose:** Solves a real-world problem for the veteran community by simplifying a confusing process.
*   **Lifecycle:** I managed the entire project lifecycle, from initial concept and design to coding, publishing, and ongoing updates based on user feedback.

### ðŸ”­ What I'm Focused On
*   **Lifelong Learning:** Learning new things is my favorite thing to do. It's really what drives me and keeps me motivated.
*   **Open-Source Contribution:** I am always looking for opportunities to contribute to open-source projects that align with my values and skills.
